# Threads_cpp_app

This is a simple desktop application developed in C++ using the Qt framework.

It was created as part of a university programming course, with the goal of exploring and practicing multithreading in C++. The project demonstrates how to work with threads in Qt using QThread, QRunnable, and the signal-slot mechanism for safe communication between threads and the GUI.
